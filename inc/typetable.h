 * 
 * \details A typetable is a data structure used to store type information
 * associated with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes. It allows the compiler to
 * map AST nodes to their corresponding type descriptors, enabling efficient
 * retrieval and modification of type information during various compilation
 * passes. This is crucial for performing type checking, type inference, and
 * generating optimized code based on the inferred types.
