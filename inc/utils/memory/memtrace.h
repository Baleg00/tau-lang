 * \brief Memory tracing library interface.
 * 
 * \details The memory tracing library is a utility that helps in tracking and
 * managing memory allocations and deallocations in the program. It intercepts
 * the memory allocation and deallocation calls, allowing developers to monitor
 * and analyze memory usage at runtime. The memory tracing library can detect
 * memory leaks, identify excessive memory allocations, and provide insights
 * into memory usage patterns. It can also collect statistics and generate
 * reports to aid in debugging and optimizing memory usage. The memory tracing
 * library is a useful tool for diagnosing memory-related issues and improving
 * the overall memory management of the application.
