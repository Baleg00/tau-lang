 * \brief Arena allocator interface.
 * 
 * \details An arena allocator is a memory allocation strategy that allocates
 * memory from a fixed-size block of memory called an arena. It is particularly
 * useful in situations where a large number of objects are allocated and
 * deallocated together as a group, such as within a specific scope or during
 * the execution of a function. Instead of individually allocating and
 * deallocating memory for each object, the arena allocator allocates memory
 * in bulk for the entire group. This improves memory allocation and
 * deallocation efficiency by reducing the overhead associated with frequent
 * memory management operations.
