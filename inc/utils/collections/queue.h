 * \brief Stack data structure interface.
 * 
 * \details A queue is a linear data structure that follows the
 * First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is similar to a queue of people
 * waiting in line, where the first person to join the queue is the first one
 * to be served. Elements can only be inserted at the back and removed from the
 * front of the queue. This ensures that the order of insertion is preserved.
 * Common queue operations include offer (adding an item to the back), poll
 * (removing the front item), and peek (viewing the front item without removing
 * it).
