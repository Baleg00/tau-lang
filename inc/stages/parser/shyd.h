 * \brief Shunting yard algorithm.
 * 
 * \details The shunting yard algorithm, devised by Edsger Dijkstra, is a method
 * for parsing expressions specified in infix notation into postfix notation,
 * also known as Reverse Polish Notation. The shunting yard algorithm serves as
 * a crucial component in the syntax analysis, enabling the compiler to
 * efficiently evaluate expressions and determine their order of operations
 * without the ambiguity inherent in infix notation.
