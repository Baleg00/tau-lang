 * \brief Type descriptor library interface.
 * 
 * \details Type descriptors store information about the characteristics and
 * properties of data types. They provide essential details about a type, such
 * as its size, alignment, modifiers (like const and mut), and its relationship
 * to other types (e.g., pointers, arrays, functions). Type descriptors
 * facilitate type checking, memory allocation, code generation, and other
 * compiler tasks by enabling the compiler to understand and manage the
 * semantics of different data types.
