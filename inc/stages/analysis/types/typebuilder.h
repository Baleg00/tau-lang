 * \brief Type builder interface.
 * 
 * \details A type builder is a utility that simplifies the process of defining
 * complex data types. It abstracts away the low-level details of type creation,
 * allowing developers to define and manipulate types in a more high-level and
 * intuitive manner. It enables the specification of the structure, fields,
 * methods, and relationships of custom types in a concise and readable way,
 * improving code maintainability and reducing the risk of type-related errors.
