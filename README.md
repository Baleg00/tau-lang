<h1 align="center">A unified language for efficient and expressive code.</h1>

---

Welcome to Tau, a programming language designed to be simple yet powerful. This
repository contains the compiler for Tau, written in C and utilizing LLVM for
backend processing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project is in its early stages, and the language is still evolving.

## üöÄ Features

### Syntax

- Clean, concise, consistent.
- Keywords are short and recognizable (`fun`, `pub`, `unit` etc.).
- Similar to other popular languages like C/C++ and Rust.

### Types

- Strong and strict type system.
- Bounds checked arrays.
- No null pointers, explicit optionals (`?i32`).
- References (`&i32`).
- `unit` instead of `void`.
- Structs, unions, enums.

### Control Flow

- Conditional branches (`if-then`, `else`).
- Loops (`while-do`, `do-while`).
- Deferred statements (`defer`).

### Functions

- Simple function definitions (`fun factorial(x: i32): i32`).
- External function declarations (`extern "C" fun sqrtf(x: f32): f32`).

### Expressions

- Arithmetic, logical, bitwise and comparison operators.
- Safe and unsafe optional operators (`x?`, `x!`).
- Memory related operators (`*x`, `&x`).
- Special operators (`sizeof`, `alignof`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- **CMake**: Build tool to configure and manage the build process.
- **LLVM**: Used as the backend for code generation and optimization.

### Building the Compiler

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Baleg00/tau-lang.git
    cd tau-lang
    ```

2. **Create a Build Directory**:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. **Configure the Project**:

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

4. **Build the Project**:

    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```

5. **Install**:

   ```bash
    cmake --install .
    ```
   
   After installation add the folder (where Tau was installed to) to your
   environment variables.

6. **Verify Installation**:

   Verify that Tau was installed correctly by running the following command:

   ```sh
   tauc --version
   ```

   This should display the installed Tau version.

üëè That's it! You're now ready to start using Tau for your programming projects.
If you encounter any problems during installation or have questions, feel free to
open an issue.

‚ù§Ô∏è Happy coding with Tau!

## üì¶ Usage

Here's how you can create and compile your first Tau program.

1. **Create Source File**:

   Create a file called `hello.tau` and add the following code:
   
   ```tau
   extern "C" fun printf(fmt: *u8, ...): i32
   
   fun main(): i32 {
     printf("Hello World!")
     
     return 0
   }
   ```
   
2. **Compile**:

   Compile the Tau source code into an object file.

   ```sh
   tauc --emit-obj hello.tau
   ```

3. **Link**:

   Use a linker to compile the generated object file into an executable.
   
   ```sh
   gcc -o hello.exe ./hello.tau.obj
   ```

4. **Run**:

   Run the executable! If everything went according to plan, you should see
   `Hello World` printed to your screen.

   ```sh
   ./hello.exe
   ```
