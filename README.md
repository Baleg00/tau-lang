## üì¶ Usage

Here's how you can create and compile your first Tau program.

Create a file called `my_program.tau` and add the following code:

```tau
use std.io

fun main(): i32 {
  stdout.write("Hello World!")
  return 0
}
```

Once that's done, you can compile the program by typing:

```sh
tau build my_program.tau -o my_program
```

And to run it:

```sh
./my_program
```

If everything went according to plan, you should see the following printed to
your screen:

```text
Hello World!
```
